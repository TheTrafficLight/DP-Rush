    <h1>Quality Education</h1>

    <div class="middleColumn">
        <p>In 2015, the United Nations adopted 17 goals as a part of their sustainable development agenda.  One of such goals is “Quality Education” The Un gives a definition for this goal on their website:</p>
        <p id="quote">Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all</p>
        <p>However, the current systems of education adopted by most countries don’t achieve this. These systems fail to provide equitable quality education. The standard of education is currently not good enough. This is something that affects me especially as I am often frustrated by the level of education I receive and don’t feel that it caters towards me well.</p>
